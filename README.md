# Currencies
Deployment : https://currencies-application.herokuapp.com/

Please notice that the deployed app might be asleep, so the first time you try to launch it will probably hang up. Dont panic!!!! :), this is an expected behaviour of the app due to it being served in a freemium model. Please try to launch again after some seconds.

This is an assignment project. In this project I have built a website where a user can see information about different crypto coins. There are 3 main sections:
1) Home where a user can see exchange rates of the currencies.
2) Live reports where a user can see exchange rates in live of selected currencies.
3) About page where I explain a little about the website. 

The data is fetched from the CoinGecko website: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api

The project was built with javascript, jquery, html and css

In the future it will be updated in a modular form and perhaps I'll use a framework instead of javascript vanilla
